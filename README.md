# k-medoids-clustering

Study project written in R language.

The purpose of project is to do clustering in populations taken from Genetic Algorithm solutions. 
In this case, using GA I am solving fitness functions from *cec2013* package. K-medoids clustering algorithm is used then to analyze final population.
